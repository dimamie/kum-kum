# Designer Portfolio

A clean, responsive single-page portfolio for designers.

## Quick start
- Open `index.html` in your browser, or
- Serve locally for proper routing/caching:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 5173
```
Then visit `http://localhost:5173`.

## Customize
- Update name, bio, and contact in `index.html`.
- Replace project cards and links in the Work section.
- Tweak colors, spacing, and typography in `styles.css`.
- Swap `assets/favicon.svg` with your own mark.

## Deploy
Host the folder on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
